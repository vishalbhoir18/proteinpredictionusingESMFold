## Introduction
Protein structure prediction is a crucial task in biochemistry and molecular biology. This web app leverages the ESMFold model to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences. The app is designed to be user-friendly and educational, making it a valuable tool for students, educators, and researchers.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy use.
- **Protein Structure Visualization**: Uses py3Dmol and stmol for 3D visualization.
- **ESMFold Integration**: Predicts protein structures using the ESMFold model from Meta.
- **Downloadable Results**: Allows users to download the predicted PDB files.

Installation
To run this app locally, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit stmol py3Dmol requests biotite altair pillow
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/protein-structure-prediction.git
    cd protein-structure-prediction
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

4. Enter a protein sequence (up to 400 amino acids) in the sidebar and click the "Predict" button to visualize the predicted structure.
